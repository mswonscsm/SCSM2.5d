# SCSM2.5d
SCSM2.5D is a 2.5D seismic wave modeling program that uses a subdomain Chebyshev spectral finite difference method.The program can handle various modeling scenarios including viscoacoustic, isotropic viscoelastic, anisotropic viscoelastic (VTI, ORT, and TTI), solid and water free surfaces, and water-solid interfaces.
